# LangGraph & LangChain Project Series  

## Overview
According to [LangChain's official documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/workflows-agents):

> **Workflows** have predetermined code paths and are designed to operate in a certain order.
> **Agents** are dynamic and define their own processes and tool usage.

This repository is part of my ongoing series of projects designed to build **familiarity with LangGraph** and **LangChain**—two powerful frameworks for developing **AI-driven systems** that combine reasoning, memory, and structured task orchestration.  

Each part of this series focuses on a specific aspect of intelligent agent design, starting from static, rule-based workflows and progressing toward dynamic, autonomous AI agents.

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand how **LangGraph** structures logic using **states**, **nodes**, and **edges**  
- Learn to design **workflows** that control and monitor AI behavior predictably  
- Gain practical experience integrating **LLMs**, **retrieval tools**, and **self-evaluation loops**  
- Transition from **workflows** → **multi-agent systems** capable of decision-making and collaboration  

## 📂 Project Structure

| Part | Title | Description | Link |
|------|--------|--------------|------|
| 1 | **Workflows** | Implements a LangGraph-based **IT support ticket system** using a structured workflow. The system classifies support tickets, retrieves knowledge base entries, drafts responses, and self-evaluates them. | [Part 1: Workflows](./Part%201:%20Workflows/Part%201:%20Workflows.md) |
| 2 | **Agents** *(coming soon)* | Expands on the previous system by introducing **autonomous agents** capable of dynamic reasoning, task delegation, and self-correction. | _In progress_ |
