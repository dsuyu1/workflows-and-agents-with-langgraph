# Workflows and AI Agents with LangGraph

In this project, I build a workflow using LangGraph. I will use [this](https://youtu.be/mRx12jkugTE?si=48OSoke3ebptm8gn) tutorial from Venelin Valkov as a guide. However, my implementation is unique and is working as of today's date (11/1/2025).

Feel free to skip forward to the end to see my final product!

## Introduction

According to [LangChain's official documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/workflows-agents):

> **Workflows** have predetermined code paths and are designed to operate in a certain order.
> **Agents** are dynamic and define their own processes and tool usage.

I'll build two implementations of the IT support ticket system - one with workflows and the other with AI agents to understand the differences and use cases.

The LangGraph library is focused around building workflows and AI agents.

As previously mentioned, our use case is an **intelligent support ticket triage**.

### Problem Statement

Our company is drowning in support tickets. The IT team could use some help! ⚠️

### Proposed Solution

Intelligent ticket processing that:

* Classifies the ticket type (technical, billing, general)
* Retrieves relevant solutions from a knowledge base
* Drafts helpful responses using found information
* Reviews and revises its own work until quality standards are met

The system is rule-based enough to be predictable, complex enough to need orchestration.

### Why don't we just use simple LLM calls?

Simple LLM calls that use if/else statements and loops are fine for systems with 1-2 nodes, but managing and maintaining a complex system with just if/else and loops is too cumbersome. Business logic gets buried, and manual state management is a pain.

LangGraph gives us **three** building blocks to design AI systems like production workflows:

* **State**: This is the system's memory 🧠. The state tracks everything from `ticket_text` to `draft_response`.
* **Nodes**: Nodes are Python functions that do one job well. For example `classify_ticket`, `draft_response`, `evaluate_draft`.
* **Edges**: The paths between the nodes. They are direct connections or conditional logic.

### Workflows vs. Agents: Who's in Control?

| Workflows                              | Agents                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Developer controls every step          | LLM decides the strategy                       |
| Fixed, predictable path                | Dynamic ReAct loop (Reason -> Act -> Observe)  |
| Perfect for compliance, data pipelines | Perfect for research, creative problem-solving |
| Rock solid reliability                 | Adaptive intelligence                          |

Within a workflow, as a developer, we can control every step of the process. It is easy to debug too!

AI agents are all the rage right now, but even with powerful LLMs, if we have a specific workflow that needs to be done in a specific order, agents are not able to follow through how we might want them to.

### Human-in-the-Loop: Our Safety Net

Autonomous agents are powerful but can be expensive when they go wrong. We need human oversight, especially in enterprise/production environments.

We can **add strategic checkpoints:**

* Before **high impact** actions (escalations, billing)
* When AI is **uncertain** (low confidence scores)
* Final quality gate (customer-facing responses)

For example, we can have a function that freezes the graph and waits for human review right before it escalates a ticket.

Human-in-the-loop takes a cool AI demo app to something you can actually use in production. With humans "in the loop," we can relax knowing that AI won't go crazy. :relieved:

## Part 1: Workflow

We start by importing everything we need. Most of them come from LangChain. The LangGraph imports will help us build our state graphs.

```python
%pip install -Uqqq pip --progress-bar off
%pip install -Uqqq langchain --progress-bar off
%pip install -Uqqq langchain-openai --progress-bar off
%pip install -Uqqq langchain-google-genai --progress-bar off
%pip install -Uqqq langchain-ollama --progress-bar off
%pip install -Uqqq langchain-community --progress-bar off
%pip install -Uqqq pypdf --progress-bar off
%pip install -Uqqq fastembed --progress-bar off
%pip install -Uqqq langgraph --progress-bar off
%pip install -Uqqq langchain-core --progress-bar off
```

```python
# Used to easily create classes for storing data.
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
# Provides type hints for better code readability and maintainability.
from typing import Annotated, List, TypedDict
# Used to display images and other rich output in IPython/Colab.
from IPython.display import Image, display
# Initializes a chat model for language model interactions.
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
# Provides fast and efficient embeddings for text.
from langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
# Represents a document object, often used in retrieval systems.
from langchain_core.documents import Document
# Represents different types of messages in a conversation.
from langchain_core.messages import AnyMessage, HumanMessage
# Creates templates for generating chat prompts.
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
# Decorator to define a function as a tool for language models.
from langchain_core.tools import tool
# An in-memory vector store for storing and searching vector embeddings.
from langchain_core.vectorstores import InMemoryVectorStore
# Components for building state graphs in LangGraph.
from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph
# Function to add messages to the state in LangGraph.
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
```

Initially, I was going to use `gpt-oss`'s latest model provided by Ollama. However, I was having trouble with my API key and whatnot, so I decided to take the easiest route and just use a Hugging Face model saved locally in my Google Colab environment.

```py
from langchain_community.llms import HuggingFacePipeline
from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline("text2text-generation", model="google/flan-t5-large", temperature=0.7, max_length=512)
llm = HuggingFacePipeline(pipeline=pipe)
```

### Adding a dataclass

Our intelligent system workflow starts by defining a **state**. We'll use a `dataclass` to define our state. In LangChain, a `dataclass` is utilized as a method for **defining the structure of data**, particularly within the context of managing state in LangGraph.

```python
@dataclass # defines structure of our LangChain state
class TicketTriageState:
  ticket_text: str
  classification: str = ""
  retrieved_docs: List[Document] = field(default_factory=lambda: [])
  draft_response: str = ""
  evaluation_feedback: str = ""
  revision_count: int = 0
```

### A quick explanation of nodes in LangGraph

<img src="nodes_graphic.png" alt="nodes" width="500"/>

In LangGraph, a **node** is a *function* that represents a single unit of computation or a specific step in a workflow.

### Classification of the prompt

```python
CLASSIFY_PROMPT = """
Classify this support ticket into one of the following categories:
'Technical Issue', 'Billing Inquiry', 'General Question'.

<ticket>
{ticket_text}
</ticket>
""".strip()

def classify_ticket(state: TicketTriageState) -> dict:
  classification = llm.invoke(CLASSIFY_PROMPT.format(ticket_text=state.ticket_text))
  return {"classification": classification}
```

### Contacting the knowledge base

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import FastEmbedEmbeddings

knowledge_base = [
    "For login issues, tell the user to try resetting their password via the 'Forgot Password' link.",
    "Billing inquiries should be escalated to the billing department by creating a ticket in Salesforce.",
    "The app is known to crash on startup if the user's cache is corrupted. The standard fix is to clear the application cache.",
]
embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

vector_store = InMemoryVectorStore.from_texts(knowledge_base, embeddings)
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever()


def retrieve_knowledge(state: TicketTriageState) -> dict:
    retrieved_docs = retriever.invoke(state.ticket_text)
    return {"retrieved_docs": retrieved_docs}
```

### Drafting the response

```python
DRAFT_PROMPT = """
Based on this context:
<context>
{context}
</context>

Draft a response for this ticket:
<ticket>
{ticket}
</ticket>
""".strip()

def draft_response(state: TicketTriageState) -> dict:
  context = "\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in state.retrieved_docs])
  prompt = DRAFT_PROMPT.format(context=context, ticket=state.ticket_text)
  draft = llm.invoke(prompt)
  return {"draft_response": draft}
```

### Response evaluation

```python
EVALUATE_PROMPT = """
Does this draft
<draft>
{draft_response}
</draft>

fully address the ticket

<ticket>
{ticket_text}
</ticket>

If not, provide feedback.
Respond with 'PASS' or 'FAIL: [feedback]'."
""".strip()

def evaluate_draft(state: TicketTriageState) -> dict:
  evaluation_prompt = EVALUATE_PROMPT.format(
    draft_response=state.draft_response,
    ticket_text=state.ticket_text,
  )
  evaluation_result = llm.invoke(evaluation_prompt)
  revision_count = state.revision_count + 1
  return {"evaluation_feedback": evaluation_result, "revision_count": revision_count}
```

### Revising the response draft

```python
REVISE_PROMPT = """
Revise this draft:
<draft>
{draft_response}
</draft>

based on the following feedback:

<feedback>
{evaluation_feedback}
</feedback>
""".strip()

def revise_response(state: TicketTriageState) -> dict:
  revise_prompt = REVISE_PROMPT.format(
    draft_response=state.draft_response,
    evaluation_feedback=state.evaluation_feedback,
  )
  return {"draft_response": llm.invoke(revise_prompt)}
```

### If "FAIL," revise

```python
def should_revise(state: TicketTriageState) -> str:
    feedback = state.evaluation_feedback
    revision_count = state.revision_count

    if "FAIL" in feedback and revision_count < 3:
        return "revise"
    else:
        return "end"
```

### Generating our graph

```python
graph = StateGraph(TicketTriageState)

graph.add_node("classify", classify_ticket)
graph.add_node("retrieve", retrieve_knowledge)
graph.add_node("draft", draft_response)
graph.add_node("evaluate", evaluate_draft)
graph.add_node("revise", revise_response)

graph.add_edge("classify", "retrieve")
graph.add_edge("retrieve", "draft")
graph.add_edge("draft", "evaluate")
graph.add_edge("revise", "evaluate")

graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "evaluate",
    should_revise,
    {
        "revise": "revise",
        "end": END,
    },
)

graph.set_entry_point("classify")
app = graph.compile()
```

### Displaying the graph

```python
display(Image(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```

<img src="graph2.png" alt="nodes" width="300"/>

### Running the workflow

```py
initial_state = { 
    "ticket_text": "My login is broken, please help!",
    "retrieved_docs": [],
    "classification": "",
    "draft_response": ""
}

final_state = app.invoke(initial_state) 

print("=== TICKET TRIAGE RESULTS ===")
print(f"Original Ticket: {final_state['ticket_text']}")
print(f"Classification: {final_state['classification']}") 
print(f"\nResponse:\n{final_state['draft_response']}")
```

### Printing the final classification

```py
print(final_state["classification"])
```

### Printing the revision count

```py
print(final_state["revision_count"])
```

### Print the draft of the response

```py
print(final_state["draft_response"])
```

The response from the model was:

> For login issues, tell the user to try resetting their password via the 'Forgot Password' link. The app is known to crash on startup if the user's cache is corrupted. The standard fix is to clear the application cache. Billing inquiries should be escalated to the billing department by creating a ticket in Salesforce.

There are some issues I want to address, especially regarding the response from the model, but for now, let's call it a win and move on! ⭐

## Conclusion and Next Steps
This concludes Part 1: Workflows, and the end of my introduction to LangChain. In this project, I implemented an intelligent IT support ticket system using LangGraph’s workflow architecture. The system classifies support tickets, retrieves relevant knowledge base entries, drafts responses, and self-evaluates its output until it meets quality standards. Through this process, I learned how LangGraph’s core components—**state**, **nodes**, and **edges**—enable structured and predictable orchestration of AI tasks. This workflow-based design serves as a foundation for my next step: building the same system using **AI agents** to explore dynamic, decision-making behavior.
